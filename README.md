# PT Clinic

This single page website is meant to demonstrate how a high level of polish and dsign can be achieved with very simple code. My girlfriend asked me to build a website for a group project in her final year of grad school, and I wanted to see how easily I could make a polished, well designed, and professional looking site for her ficticious Physical Therapy Clinic, using almost exclusively HTML. I used a slew of templates, assets, and custom classes from a library called <a href="https://mdbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">MDBootstrap</a>, and over a very short period of time I was able to create the landing page that you can see in the link above.
